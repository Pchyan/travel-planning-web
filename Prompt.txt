Prompt:

Design and develop a web-based travel planning software that allows users to create and customize their travel itineraries. The software should provide an intuitive user interface with the following features:

出发点输入：

Users can input their starting point (e.g., city or location) when they begin using the tool.
景点的灵活添加与删除：

Users should be able to add new travel destinations to a list and remove any destination at any time, with an easy-to-use interface (e.g., a button for adding/removing).
行程自动调整：

The software should automatically adjust the order of the planned itinerary based on the current list of added destinations.
交通方式建议：

Between each pair of consecutive destinations, the system should suggest appropriate transportation options (e.g., by calling an API like Google Maps API for distance and travel time).
景点停留时间建议：

For each destination, the system should provide a recommended duration of stay based on typical visit durations (e.g., 1-2 hours for major attractions).
总和行程时间管理：

The software should automatically calculate the total time of the itinerary and adjust the order if the total exceeds a reasonable daily limit, moving any overflow to the next day.
